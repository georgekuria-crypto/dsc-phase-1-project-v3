## BEST AIRCRAFTS TO PURCHASE 

# Project Overview

This project aims to provide insights to help the  head of the new aviation division to make final decisions on the best aircraft to purchase.This decision will be influenced by the aircrafts with the lowest fatality and risks associated with them from the Aviation Data.

The problem to solve for this project is to determine which aircrafts have the lowest risk in terms of accidents by cleaning and analyzing this data and getting at least three insights for the business and steer them in the right  direction according to the data which shows accident data from 1962.
